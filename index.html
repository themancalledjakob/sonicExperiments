        <h1>Sound Design Assignment I - 02.02.2016</h1>

<p>I removed the sound of three movie scenes for you: <br />
- Tuttle's End (Brazil)<br />
- Cropduster (North By Northwest)<br />
- Arthur Zanetti Artistic Rings Gold (Olympics 2012)</p>

<p>My assignment for you is to make a soundscape for these movie scenes, and try to change how they feel.</p>

<p>Instructions:<br />
- pic two of the movie scenes (north by north west, brazil or olympics)<br />
- download them here: http://we.tl/qD90oTNWJI<br />
- rent an audiorecorder for today (when you say it's for the course you don't have to pay. otherwise you'll get it back next week)<br />
- record sound and noises around the academy that you think fit to the atmosphere of the scene.<br />
- put your recordings under the scenes and bring them next week.</p>

<p>Important is here more the atmospheric fit, and NOT the editing. <br />
Keep the recordings as raw as possible. You should think about how you can influence or control the perception of the scenes, and how much power the sound gives you here. It does not have to be perfect. Your recordings will probably be rough, use that for expression! </p>

<p>That's it :-)</p>

<p>We'll discuss your recordings next week then when I'm there, but let me know if you have any questions!</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>

<p>Best,<br />
Jakob</p>
